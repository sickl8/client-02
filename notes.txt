to get the function that repeats itself where you send the info to the DOM:
1. search for a call to requestAnimation, it takes a callback function as a
parameter.
2. search in the callback function for the regex expression:
<<< if \(!_0x[a-zA-Z_0-9]*\.cHideMinimap\) >>>
only one match should be found, the if condition calls another function that we
will call PRE.
3. go to PRE, there is an if condition that that matches the regex expression:
<<< if \(_0x[\w]*.state === _0x[\w]*.ALIVE && _0x[\w]*.id != _0x[\w]*.playerId\) >>>
in the if condition there is a call to the function that repeats itself
